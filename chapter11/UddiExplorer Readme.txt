Remember to download and install the UDDI 2 SDK. Then reference the UDDI assembly before
you try running the application.

I've pre-entered the URL for a UDDI server as "http://uddi.microsoft.com/inquire.asmx".
This application will work just as well with a public UDDI server as with a corporate
UDDI server.
