				Binary Formatter Error
				<br>
				<br>
				The error you will see is the following:
				<br>
				<STRONG>An unhandled exception of type 'System.Runtime.Serialization. 
					SerializationException' occurred in mscorlib.dll
					<BR>
					Additional information: BinaryFormatter Version incompatibility. Expected 
					Version 1.0. Received Version 1008738336.1684104552.</STRONG>
				<br>
				<br>
				First, you need to understand why you are receving the binary formatter 
				exception. The reason is that there is a problem with the connection to the 
				server. The IIS server then returns an error in SOAP format that starts with 
				something like the following "HTTP 1.1 ". Since you are using a binary 
				formatter the first thing .NET looks for is the version information and it sees 
				"1.1" when it is expecting a binary version number of 1.0. This causes the 
				binary formatter exception.
				<br>
				<br>
				Second, you need to know how to get to the root cause of the exception. The 
				root cause is typically a malformed web.config file or an error in the coding 
				on the client side. Any other error will return a regular exception that can be 
				diagnosed in the design environment. So how do you get additional information 
				on the exception. There are two ways to do this:
				<br>
				<br>
				- Use a program called TCPTrace available from 
				http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/ This program sends a stream from the client 
				to the server through a sniffer that captures all outgoing and incoming data 
				over the specified port. HOWEVER, there is an issue with this in that it will 
				not work for this particular application because it uses Integrated 
				Authentication and TCPTrace cannot forward the NT Security Token.
				<br>
				<br>
			- Switch from the binaryformatter to the soapformatter. To do this, change the 
			code in the frmMain form constructor method form the binaryformatter to the 
			soapformatter as follows: chan = New HttpChannel(props, New 
			SoapClientFormatterSinkProvider, New _ SoapServerFormatterSinkProvider) Do not 
			run the application when you're not debugging in this mode as it is orders of 
			magnitude slower as you'll.

				Several readers have mentioned that I had a tendency throughout the book to 
				create an instance of a manager class using the following code:
				<br>
				<br>
				Dim objEmployeeMgr as ucEmployeeMgr = objEmployeeMgr.GetInstance()
				<br>
				<br>
				This method works in version 1.0 and 1.1 however, since GetInstance is a shared 
				method, technically the call should be made as follows:
				<br>
				<br>
				Dim objEmployeeMgr as ucEmployeeMgr = ucEmployeeMgr.GetInstance()
